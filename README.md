# Music-recommender-Decision-tree-
🎵 Music Recommender using Decision Tree This project builds a simple music genre recommender using a Decision Tree Classifier based on user attributes like age and gender. It demonstrates basic machine learning concepts using the scikit-learn library in Python.

This project is a simple and beginner-friendly **Music Recommender System** powered by a **Decision Tree Classifier**. Given a person's **age** and **gender**, the system predicts what type of music they’re likely to enjoy.

Whether you're new to machine learning or exploring decision trees, this project offers a clear, hands-on example.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

- 📊 Reads a small dataset containing age, gender, and music preferences.
- 🌳 Trains a **Decision Tree Classifier** to learn from this data.
- 🖼️ Visualizes how the decision tree makes predictions.
- 🎧 Lets you input new user data and predicts their music preference.
- 📈 Checks how well the model performs on unseen data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open the notebook using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Upload the sample dataset (or your own!).
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step:
   - Train the model.
   - Visualize the decision tree.
   - Predict music preferences for new users.
   - See how accurate your model is.
